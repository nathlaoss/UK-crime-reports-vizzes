# UK-crime-reports-vizzes
Visualizations in Tableau of data on crime reports in UK.

Data has been collected from https://data.police.uk/.

***

Folder data contains the collected data.

In a file called data-prep.ipynb there is code for processing and preparing data for exporting and usage in Tableau.

File crime-and-policing-in-uk.twb contains sheets and dashboards created on the aforementioned data, which ranges from 2019-7 to 2022-06.
Dashboards have been created with intention of interaction, which is possible for anyone with access to Tableau Desktop.

In a folder called 'samples' I am sharing a few of the created visualizations, although they have most value when viewed directly from .twb file, as for possibility of interaction.

Here are a few conclusions from the visualized data:
* there was an overall intense increase of reports of anti-social behaviour from March 2020 (111 935 reports) to May 2020 (230 889 reports) - which is most possibly linked with COVID-19 disease situation; also there was a notable increase of reports of the same crime type solely from Metropolitan Police Service from February 2022 (15 589) and March 2022 (35 180), which decreased on April 2022 (18 299)
* there is a seasonal factor when it comes to crime reports, with more reports on May, June and July and less reports on December, January and February (differences between months with most and least numerous reports in a year are about 100K reports)
* overall most common crime type is violence and sexual offences, followed by anti-social behaviour; the least common is possession of weapons
* in some polices forces, f.e. Lancashire Constabulary and Metropolitian Police Service, most numerous are reports of anti-social behaviours, instead of violence and sexual offences
